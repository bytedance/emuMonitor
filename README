Thanks for downloading emuMonitor.

emuMonitor is a tool for "palladium" and "zebu" usage information data-collection,
data-analysis and data-display.


The tool use flow is as below:
# For palladium:
    installation -> configuration -> sampling -> monitoring

# For zebu:
    installation -> configuration -> monitoring


INSTALLATION:
================
To install it, make sure you have Python 3.8.8 installed, you can also install 
Anaconda3-2021.05 to solve packge dependency. Then run below command to install it:
Come into install directory, then execute below command.

    python3 install.py


CONFIGURATION:
================
After installing the tool, come into <EMU_MONITOR_INSTALL_PATH>/config directory,
then update file config.py for your own configuration.
# For palladium:

    db_path = ""
    Z1_test_server = ""
    Z2_test_server = ""
    Z1_test_server_host = ""
    Z2_test_server_host = "
    project_list_file = ""
    project_execute_host_file = ""
    project_user_file = ""
    project_primary_factors = ""

"db_path" is used to save database files, default is on <EMU_MONITOR_INSTALL_PATH>/db,
you can re-point it into your own path.
"Z1_test_server" is used to specify test_server path for palladium Z1.
"Z2_test_server" is used to specify test_server path for palladium Z2.
"Z1_test_server_host" is used to specify test_server default execute host for palladium Z1.
"Z2_test_server_host" is used to specify test_server default execute host for palladium Z2.
"project_list_file" is used to specify project list
"project_execute_host_file" is used to specify project execute host file
"project_user_file" is used to specify project user file
"project_primary_factors" is used to specify project primary factors

# For zebu:

    module = ""
    bash = ""
    check_status_command = ""
    check_report_command = ""

module is what you need to load before use zRscManager.
bash is what you need to source before use zRscManager.
check_status_command is used to check current zebu status.
check_report_command is used to check history zebu status.

SAMPLING:
================
Use bin/psample sample current palladium usage information first, then pmonitor can show
palladium current/history/utilization information.
Below is the suggested crontab setting on sampling data.

On Z1 compile host.
SHELL=/bin/csh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:<BSUB_PATH>
0 */2 * * * <PALLADIUM_MONITOR_INSTALL_PATH>/bin/psample -H Z1

On Z2 compile host.
SHELL=/bin/csh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:<BSUB_PATH>
0 */2 * * * <PALLADIUM_MONITOR_INSTALL_PATH>/bin/psample -H Z2

Suggested sampling frequency is 2 hours.


MONITORING:
================
Execute below command to start palladium monitor function.
<EMU_MONITOR_INSTALL_PATH>/bin/pmonitor

Execute below command to start zebu monitor function.
<ZEBU_MONITOR_INSTALL_PATH>/bin/zmonitor
